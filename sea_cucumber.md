      **Local Stakeholders:**
      We partnered with local artisanal fishermen and researchers to design our sampling strategy. 
      Experienced local fishers then led the sample collection, ensuring success through their expertise and knowledge of the waters.

      **Sampling:**
      We collected samples from across the Galápagos archipelago and the coast of Ecuador, gathering 290 individuals for high-depth whole-genome sequencing. 
      So far, 210 genomes have already been sequenced.

     **Genome Assembly:**
     By precisely mapping the genetic connections within the brown sea cucumber’s DNA, we now have a complete and reliable reference for this species. 
     This breakthrough opens the door to deeper discoveries and more effective conservation efforts in the Galápagos.

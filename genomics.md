      Even though the Galápagos is home to remarkable ocean life, scientific studies have mostly concentrated on creatures living on land. 
      More research is urgently needed to better protect and understand the islands’ marine species.

      This pattern is even clearer when we look at complete genome assemblies. While several land species have high-quality genomes, only a single marine species has been sequenced so far. 
      Expanding genomic resources for marine life is key to unlocking new conservation solutions in the Galápagos.

     The Galápagos Marine Reserve shelters 3,000 marine species, including 600 found nowhere else. Yet for most, crucial genetic data is missing. Unlocking these secrets is vital to safeguard their future. 
      **Now is the time to close the genomic gap.**
